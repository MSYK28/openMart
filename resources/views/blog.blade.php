        <h3>The Holiday Special</h3>
        <p>
            My dad used to make me pancakes almost every morning when I was in school. He would do fun shapes and letters. As an adult I donâ€™t know how he did it, heâ€™s super dad! I love making breakfast foods but we are usually running out the door eating breakfast in the car a lot of the times haha. Come weekends though I always make a good breakfast on Sundays, and leading up to holidays I like to do themes. Valentineâ€™s is one of my favorites because you know how much I love the pink color scheme ðŸ˜‰<br>

            I saw this idea online so I ordered some food coloring, berries, sprinkles, and a few other details on Walmart+ to save me a trip to the store. As much as I wish I was a planner and able to plan out a full grocery list and order once a week, most of the time Iâ€™m having last minute ideas like this or I remember something I forgot, so I love being able to order groceries for right when I need them.<br>

            I also got these cute plastic flutes to make a cotton candy mocktail which was no question the kidsâ€™ favorite part haha. We added some White Cran-Strawberry juice and a pink sugar rim â€“ loved the idea for a cute, festive kids drink. With a Walmart+ membership you get free same-day delivery from your store and  free shipping with no order minimum. (Free Same-Day Delivery- $35 order min. Restrictions apply.; Free Shipping, No order minimum- Excludes most Marketplace items, location & freight surcharges.<br>

            <br>
            RECIPE:

            I used Bisquick pancake mix and followed the instructions on the back. I made the first handful of pancakes with just the normal pancake mix, then separated 4 bowls for other colors. I added a couple drops of pink food coloring to the batter. The pink from this set is SO bright and rich, Iâ€™m obsessed! You can just eyeball the amount of drops you want to add since it will depend on how big a batch youâ€™re making. Just start with a drop or two and mix to get an idea of the color. A little goes a long way â€“ Then after cooking the next â€˜shadeâ€™ pancakes, youâ€™ll add a few more drops of the food coloring and repeat.<br>

            You can repeat as many times as you want and go as slowly/gradually as you want but the more you do, the bigger your pancake stack haha. We just did mini stackers because I knew the kids wouldnâ€™t be able to eat that many if they were full sized. I also used this cute little mold (works for pancakes, eggs, etc) that has a circle or heart shaped option. So cute for Valentineâ€™s Day or just to use throughout the year for fun. It also made it so much easier for the stack to do multiple at once. These are AMAZING!!<br>

            We topped with berries, syrup, whipped cream and sprinkles. I also ordered these edible flower petals that would be so pretty for a Valentineâ€™s Day brunch with your partner or even a baby shower/bridal shower brunch. I forgot to put them on when we did this so Iâ€™m going to use them when I make it again they are SO PRETTY!!
